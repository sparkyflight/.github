## ✨ What is Sparkyflight?
Sparkyflight isn't your typical social media network. It's a digital haven crafted specifically for the neurodiverse — especially autistic individuals — to express themselves, connect meaningfully, and explore their favorite subjects in a calm, structured, and supportive space.

Whether you're sharing hyperfixations, learning something new, or simply looking for people who get it, Sparkyflight helps you feel seen, heard, and valued — no performance required.

# 🤝 Why It Matters

Mainstream platforms often cater to fast-paced, high-pressure social dynamics that don't work for everyone — especially for those who are neurodivergent.

Sparkyflight challenges that norm.

It’s built from the ground up to honor slower communication, sensory needs, and emotional authenticity — making space for people who are often overlooked or misunderstood online.

> This isn’t about popularity.
It’s about belonging.
